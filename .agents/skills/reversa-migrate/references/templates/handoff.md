# Handoff to the Coding Agent

> This document is the entry point for the coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.) that will write the new system from the specs.

## ⚠️ Required reading first

1. **`paradigm_decision.md`**, non-negotiable reading. The target paradigm shapes how all the coding must happen.
2. **`topology_decision.md`**, non-negotiable reading. The chosen topology (preserve / modernize / hybrid) defines the folder tree and the boundaries between modules.
3. **`screen_modernization_decision.md`**, non-negotiable reading when the legacy system has a UI. The chosen mode (literal / modernized / hybrid) defines how the coder will materialize the screens.

## Recommended reading order

1. `paradigm_decision.md` (mandatory, first)
2. `topology_decision.md` (mandatory, second)
3. `screen_modernization_decision.md` (mandatory when there is a UI; skip if the Screen Translator ran in skipped mode)
4. `migration_brief.md`
5. `target_business_rules.md`
6. `migration_strategy.md`
7. `target_architecture.md`
8. `target_domain_model.md`
9. `target_data_model.md`
10. `data_migration_plan.md`
11. `target_screens.md` (when there is a UI)
12. `parity_specs.md` + `parity_tests/`
13. `screen_deviation_log.md` (advisory, when there is a UI)
14. `risk_register.md` + `cutover_plan.md`
15. `discard_log.md` (advisory)
16. `ambiguity_log.md` (advisory)

## Blockers before starting implementation
> Items that need a human decision before the coding agent starts.

- <AMB-XXX: short description + where to decide>
- <or: no blockers, proceed>

## Next steps for the coding agent

1. **Read `paradigm_decision.md` and internalize it**: the target paradigm is <from paradigm_decision>. Every code choice must honor that paradigm.
2. **Read `topology_decision.md` and internalize it**: the chosen topology is <preserve | modernize | hybrid>. Use the tree sketch recorded in that artifact as the basis for creating the new repository's folder structure.
3. **Read `screen_modernization_decision.md` and internalize it** (when there is a UI): the screen translation mode is <literal | modernized | hybrid>. In literal, materialize what is in `target_screens.md` byte-for-byte (or pixel-equivalent); in modernized, honor the component hierarchy, the tokens and the 4 states (idle, loading, error, success).
4. **Set up the new repository** with the stack declared in `migration_brief.md` and the decided topology.
5. **Implement bottom-up** following `target_architecture.md` and `target_domain_model.md`:
   - infrastructure → data → domain → application → edges.
6. **Implement the screens**, consuming `target_screens.md` as a literal contract. In literal mode with golden files present in `_reversa_sdd/screens/golden/`, the implementation's result must match the golden file within the `normalizationRules` declared in `manifest.yaml`.
7. **Write the tests** from `parity_specs.md` and `parity_tests/*.feature` from the very beginning. Honor the § Exceptions section, which reflects the deviations approved in `screen_deviation_log.md`.
8. **For each component**, validate that it respects the chosen paradigm (explicit signals in `target_architecture.md § Fidelity to the chosen paradigm`) and the chosen topology (explicit signals in `target_architecture.md § Fidelity to the chosen topology`).
9. **For the data migration**, follow `data_migration_plan.md`.
10. **For the cutover**, follow `cutover_plan.md` and the go/no-go criteria.

## Auto-decided items (only if run with --auto)
> List here the items whose default was applied without human confirmation. Reviewing them before the cutover is recommended.
